JS MMO
======

A test of the powers of the interwebs.

Description
-----------

We all know about how great HTML5 is. It's got canvas, websockets, and all kinds of stuff. However, nobody has really made an MMORPG that exclusively uses these technologies on the client side.

If they have, nobody cares about it very much.

This is also a chance for me to play around with a 2D platformer.

What It Will Be
---------------

1. You will have a house

2. In that house, you will be able to customize stuff, and eventually expand the house.

3. You will be able to link with Facebook, and someday Google+.

So, Yeah
--------

It will be using the EaselJS library for graphics, and maybe xui.js for DOM interaction.
